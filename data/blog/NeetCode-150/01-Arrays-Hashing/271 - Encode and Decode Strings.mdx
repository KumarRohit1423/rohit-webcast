# [# 271 - Encode and Decode Strings](https://leetcode.com/problems/encode-and-decode-strings/)

Design an algorithm to encode **a list of strings** to **a string**. The encoded string is then sent over the network and is decoded back to the original list of strings.

Machine 1 (sender) has the function:

```cpp
string encode(vector<string> strs) {
  // ... your code
  return encoded_string;
}
```

Machine 2 (receiver) has the function:

```cpp
vector<string> decode(string s) {
  //... your code
  return strs;
}
```

So Machine 1 does:

```
string encoded_string = encode(strs);
```

and Machine 2 does:

```
vector<string> strs2 = decode(encoded_string);
```

`strs2` in Machine 2 should be the same as `strs` in Machine 1.

Implement the `encode` and `decode` methods.

You are not allowed toÂ solve the problem using any serialize methods (such as `eval`).

**Example 1:**

```
Input: dummy_input = ["Hello","World"]
Output: ["Hello","World"]
Explanation:
Machine 1:
Codec encoder = new Codec();
String msg = encoder.encode(strs);
Machine 1 ---msg---> Machine 2

Machine 2:
Codec decoder = new Codec();
String[] strs = decoder.decode(msg);
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: dummy_input = [""]
Output: [""]
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= strs.length <= 200`
- `0 <= strs[i].length <= 200`
- `strs[i]` contains any possible characters out of `256` valid ASCII characters.

**Follow up:** Could you write a generalized algorithm to work on any possible set of characters?

# My Approach

```cpp
class Solution {
 public:
  string encode(vector<string>& strs) {
    string s = "";
    for (int i = 0; i < strs.size(); i++) {
      s.append(to_string(strs[i].size()));
      s.append("@");
      s.append(strs[i]);
    }
    return s;
  }

  vector<string> decode(string s) {
    vector<string> ans;
    int i = 0;
    while (i < s.size()) {
      int num = 0;
      while (s[i] != '@') {
        num = (num * 10) + (s[i] - '0');
        i++;
      }
      ans.push_back(s.substr(i + 1, num));
      i += (num + 1);
    }
    return ans;
  }
};
```

# Notes

To serialize the strings I merged the strings prefixed with a specific string that contains the size of the string to extract along with a (useless) special delimiter. Again there are many ways to go about this but I think this approach is satisfactory.

- This question is good as it demands a better understanding of string functions (for C++ it is the `std::string` library).
