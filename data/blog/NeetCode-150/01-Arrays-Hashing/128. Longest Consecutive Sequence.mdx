# [128. Longest Consecutive Sequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-consecutive-sequence/description/)

Given an unsorted array of integers `nums`, return the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

You must write an algorithm that runs in`O(n)`time.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [100,4,200,1,3,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`. Therefore its length is 4.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [0,3,7,2,5,8,4,6,0,1]
Output: 9
```

**Constraints:**

- `0 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`

# My Approach

```cpp
class Solution {
 public:
  int longestConsecutive(vector<int>& nums) {
    if (nums.size() == 0) {
      return 0;
    }
    map<int, int> mp;
    for (int& x : nums) {
      mp[x]++;
    }
    int longest = 0, count = 1, prev, index = 0;
    for (pair<const int, int>& x : mp) {
      if (index == 0) {
        prev = x.first;
        index++;
        continue;
      }
      if (x.first - prev == 1) {
        count++;
      } else {
        longest = max(count, longest);
        count = 1;
      }
      prev = x.first;
      index++;
    }
    longest = max(count, longest);
    return longest;
  }
};
```

# Notes

Again two ways to solve this one. Either sort the array or use map of set to keep count of integers. To keep things simple, I used a map so the keys were sorted which defeated the original requirement of O(n) algorithm. Next I optimized it using `unordered_map` which actually fulfilled the requirement.

# Better Approach

```cpp
class Solution {
 public:
  int longestConsecutive(vector<int>& nums) {
    if (nums.size() == 0) {
      return 0;
    }
    unordered_map<int, int> mp;
    for (int& x : nums) {
      mp[x]++;
    }
    int longest = 0, num = 0;
    for (pair<const int, int>& x : mp) {
      if (mp.find(x.first - 1) == mp.end()) {
        num = x.first;
        while (mp.find(num) != mp.end()) {
          num++;
        }
        longest = max(longest, (num - x.first));
      }
    }
    return longest;
  }
};
```
