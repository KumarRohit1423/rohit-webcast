# [217. Contains Duplicate](https://leetcode.com/problems/contains-duplicate/description/)

Given an integer array `nums`, return `true` if any value appears **at least twice** in the array, and return `false` if every element is distinct.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: false
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums = [1,1,1,3,3,4,3,2,4,2]
Output: true
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`

# MY Approach

```cpp
class Solution {
 public:
  bool containsDuplicate(vector<int>& nums) {
    set<int> unique;
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
      if (unique.find(nums.at(i)) != unique.end()) {
        return true;
      } else {
        unique.insert(nums.at(i));
      }
    }
    return false;
  }
};
```

# Notes

My initial as well as final approach is a straightforward one where I insert the numbers into a set and check for a number that already exists in the set. There are many ways to this question but I don't think there's a solution that would grant a much better time complexity.
