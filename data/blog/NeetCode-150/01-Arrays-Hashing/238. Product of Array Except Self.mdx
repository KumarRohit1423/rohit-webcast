# [238. Product of Array Except Self](https://leetcode.com/problems/product-of-array-except-self/description/)

Given an integer array `nums`, return an array `answer` such that `answer[i]` is equal to the product of all the elements of `nums` except `nums[i]`.

The product of any prefix or suffix of `nums` is **guaranteed** to fit in a **32-bit** integer.

You must write an algorithm that runs in`O(n)`time and without using the division operation.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [24,12,8,6]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [-1,1,0,-3,3]
Output: [0,0,9,0,0]
```

**Constraints:**

- `2 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `-30 <= nums[i] <= 30`
- The product of any prefix or suffix of `nums` is **guaranteed** to fit in a **32-bit** integer.

**Follow up:** Can you solve the problem in `O(1)` extra space complexity? (The output array **does not** count as extra space for space complexity analysis.)

# My Approach

```cpp
class Solution {
 public:
  vector<int> productExceptSelf(vector<int>& nums) {
    int n = nums.size();
    vector<int> ans(n, 0);
    int prod = 1;
    for (int i = (n - 1); i > 0; i--) {
      prod = prod * nums.at(i);
      ans.at(i) = prod;
    }
    prod = 1;
    for (int i = 0; i < (n - 1); i++) {
      ans.at(i) = prod * ans.at(i + 1);
      prod *= nums.at(i);
    }
    ans.at(n - 1) = prod;
    return ans;
  }
};
```

# Notes

Took me way too long but i figured out my initial solution along with the follow-up requirements. The first solution I had intuitively was to have two arrays namely - `prefixProduct` and `suffixProduct` and then iterate original array and store product of `prefixArray[i-1]` and `suffixArray[i+1`. The follow-up however bugged me and thus the better approach as mentioned above is to maintain a single output array and perform Prefix-Product and store the products but then adjust it by doing Suffix-Products using the original array elements.
