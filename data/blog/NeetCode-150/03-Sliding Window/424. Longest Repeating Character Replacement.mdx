# [424. Longest Repeating Character Replacement](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-repeating-character-replacement/description/)

You are given a string `s` and an integer `k`. You can choose any character of the string and change it to any other uppercase English character. You can perform this operation at most `k` times.

Return the length of the longest substring containing the same letter you can get after performing the above operations.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "ABAB", k = 2
Output: 4
Explanation: Replace the two 'A's with two 'B's or vice versa.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "AABABBA", k = 1
Output: 4
Explanation: Replace the one 'A' in the middle with 'B' and form "AABBBBA". The substring "BBBB" has the longest repeating letters, which is 4. There may exists other ways to achieve this answer too.
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 10^5`
- `s` consists of only uppercase English letters.
- `0 <= k <= s.length`

# My Approach

```cpp
class Solution {
 public:
  int characterReplacement(string s, int k) {
    int window = 0, ans = 0, maxFr = 0;
    int mp[26] = {0};
    for (int i = 0; i < s.size(); i++) {
      window++;
      mp[s.at(i) - 'A']++;
      maxFr = max(maxFr, mp[s.at(i) - 'A']);
      if (window - maxFr == k) {
        ans = max(ans, window);
      } else {
        while (window - maxFr > k) {
          mp[s.at(i - window + 1) - 'A']--;
          window--;
        }
      }
    }
    ans = max(ans, window);
    return ans;
  }
};
```

# Notes

In this question we keep count of the maximum frequency character present in our window instance and check whether the other characters to be changed are upto the limit. The problem is to decrease the maximum frequency once characters start falling out of the window.

It's a nice observation that we do not need to decrease the maximum frequency as for `(len(window) - maxFrequncy) <= limit`, a larger `len(window)` will require a bigger `maxFrequncy` to pass along as the newer answer. Kind of hard to wrap your head around but what else can you do!
