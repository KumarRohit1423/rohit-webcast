# [121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/description/)

You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the i<sup>th</sup> day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a **single day** to buy one stock and choosing a **different day in the future** to sell that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return `0`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= prices.length <= 10^5`
- `0 <= prices[i] <= 10^4`

# My Approach

```cpp
class Solution {
 public:
  int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
    int sz = prices.size(), ans = 0;
    if (sz < 2)
      return 0;
    else {
      int wb = prices[0];
      for (int i = 1; i < sz; ++i) {
        if (prices[i] - wb > 0) {
          ans = max(ans, (prices[i] - wb));
        } else {
          wb = prices[i];
        }
      }
      return ans;
    }
  }
};
```

# Notes

The starter problem to sliding window technique, we start with the first value in array and iterate till we find a bigger value. Then we switch to this bigger value and repeat. Finding smaller values will only aid to finding the profit.
