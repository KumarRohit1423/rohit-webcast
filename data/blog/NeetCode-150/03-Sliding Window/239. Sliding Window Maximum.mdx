# [239. Sliding Window Maximum](https://leetcode.com/problems/sliding-window-maximum/description/)

You are given an array of integers `nums`, there is a sliding window of size `k` which is moving from the very left of the array to the very right. You can only see the `k` numbers in the window. Each time the sliding window moves right by one position.

Return the max sliding window.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,3,-1,-3,5,3,6,7], k = 3
Output: [3,3,5,5,6,7]
Explanation:
Window position                Max
---------------               -----
[1  3  -1] -3  5  3  6  7       3
 1 [3  -1  -3] 5  3  6  7       3
 1  3 [-1  -3  5] 3  6  7       5
 1  3  -1 [-3  5  3] 6  7       5
 1  3  -1  -3 [5  3  6] 7       6
 1  3  -1  -3  5 [3  6  7]      7
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [1], k = 1
Output: [1]
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `-10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4`
- `1 <= k <= nums.length`

# My Approach

```cpp
class Solution {
 public:
  vector<int> maxSlidingWindow(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
    int window = 0, j = 0;
    deque<int> dq;
    vector<int> ans;
    while (j < nums.size()) {
      while (!dq.empty() && dq.back() < nums.at(j)) {
        dq.pop_back();
      }
      dq.push_back(nums.at(j));
      j++;
      window++;
      if (window == k) {
        ans.emplace_back(dq.front());
        if (dq.front() == nums.at(j - window)) {
          dq.pop_front();
        }
        window--;
      }
    }
    return ans;
  }
};
```

# Notes

LC Hard... something new with them every time. I understood that the question demands a maximum number in the range and this range is sliding or can change. These queries could be answered by a heap (gotta understand it one of these days) in `O(n*log(n))` time.

But here comes the hero for this question A Monotonic Queue. We can implement a deque which should be monotonically decreasing (hence the name), so the max element for a particular range is always at the left end or `front()`. To ensure this, when pushing an element from the right or `back` we always remove all elements lesser than the value to be pushed starting from the `back`. Also when a value falls off from the window, if it was the maximal element, we `pop()` it from the front.
