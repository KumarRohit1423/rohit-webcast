summary: Given two strings `s` and `t` of lengths `m` and `n` respectively, return the minimum window substring of `s` such that every character in `t` (including duplicates) is included in the window. If there is no such substring, return the empty string `""`.

# [76. Minimum Window Substring](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-window-substring/description/)

Given two strings `s` and `t` of lengths `m` and `n` respectively, return the **minimum window** **substring** of `s` such that every character in `t` (**including duplicates** ) is included in the window. If there is no such substring, return the empty string `""`.

The testcases will be generated such that the answer is **unique** .

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "ADOBECODEBANC", t = "ABC"
Output: "BANC"
Explanation: The minimum window substring "BANC" includes 'A', 'B', and 'C' from string t.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "a", t = "a"
Output: "a"
Explanation: The entire string s is the minimum window.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s = "a", t = "aa"
Output: ""
Explanation: Both 'a's from t must be included in the window.
Since the largest window of s only has one 'a', return empty string.
```

**Constraints:**

- `m == s.length`
- `n == t.length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 10^5`
- `s` and `t` consist of uppercase and lowercase English letters.

**Follow up:** Could you find an algorithm that runs in `O(m + n)` time?

# My Approach

```cpp
class Solution {
 public:
  string minWindow(string s, string t) {
    if (t.size() > s.size()) {
      return ("");
    }
    unordered_map<char, int> mpt;
    for (int i = 0; i < t.size(); i++) {
      mpt[t.at(i)]++;
    }
    int tstore = t.size(), i = 0;
    int window = 0, minWindow = INT_MAX, mstart = 0;
    while (window < s.size()) {
      if (mpt[s.at(window)] > 0) {
        tstore--;
      }
      mpt[s.at(window)]--;
      window++;
      while (tstore == 0) {
        if ((window - i) < minWindow) {
          mstart = i;
          minWindow = window - i;
        }
        mpt[s.at(i)]++;
        if (mpt[s.at(i)] > 0) {
          tstore++;
        }
        i++;
      }
    }
    if (minWindow != INT_MAX) {
      return (s.substr(mstart, minWindow));
    }
    return "";
  }
};
```
