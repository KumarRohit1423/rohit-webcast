# [11. Container With Most Water](https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/description/)

You are given an integer array `height` of length `n`. There are `n` vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the i<sup>th</sup> line are `(i, 0)` and `(i, height[i])`.

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

**Notice** that you may not slant the container.

**Example 1:**

<Image

  width={600}
  height={287}
/>

```
Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: height = [1,1]
Output: 1
```

**Constraints:**

- `n == height.length`
- `2 <= n <= 10^5`
- `0 <= height[i] <= 10^4`

# My Approach

```cpp
class Solution {
 public:
  int maxArea(vector<int>& height) {
    int st = 0, end = (height.size() - 1), ans = 0, vol;
    while (st < end) {
      vol = min(height.at(st), height.at(end)) * (end - st);
      ans = max(ans, vol);
      if (height.at(st) <= height.at(end)) {
        st++;
      } else {
        end--;
      }
    }
    return ans;
  }
};
```

# Notes

When I say I have problem implementing two-pointers, these are the questions that I am talking about. The idea here is to look for bigger bars or values when decrementing or incrementing the pointers from either end. The volume calculation was the easiest part to implement.
