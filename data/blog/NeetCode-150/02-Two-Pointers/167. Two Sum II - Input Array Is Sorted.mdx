# [167. Two Sum II - Input Array Is Sorted](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum-ii-input-array-is-sorted/description/)

Given a **1-indexed** array of integers `numbers` that is already **sorted in non-decreasing order** , find two numbers such that they add up to a specific `target` number. Let these two numbers be numbers[index<sub>1</sub>] and numbers[index<sub>2</sub>] where 1 <= index<sub>1</sub> < index<sub>2</sub> <= numbers.length.

Return the indices of the two numbers, index<sub>1</sub>`and`index<sub>2</sub>, **added by one** as an integer array [index<sub>1</sub>, index<sub>2</sub>] of length 2.

The tests are generated such that there is **exactly one solution** . You **may not** use the same element twice.

Your solution must use only constant extra space.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [1,2]
Explanation: The sum of 2 and 7 is 9. Therefore, index1 = 1, index2 = 2. We return [1, 2].
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: numbers = [2,3,4], target = 6
Output: [1,3]
Explanation: The sum of 2 and 4 is 6. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 3. We return [1, 3].
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: numbers = [-1,0], target = -1
Output: [1,2]
Explanation: The sum of -1 and 0 is -1. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 2. We return [1, 2].
```

**Constraints:**

- `2 <= numbers.length <= 3 * 10^4`
- `-1000 <= numbers[i] <= 1000`
- `numbers` is sorted in **non-decreasing order** .
- `-1000 <= target <= 1000`
- The tests are generated such that there is **exactly one solution** .

# My Approach

```cpp
class Solution {
 public:
  vector<int> twoSum(vector<int>& numbers, int target) {
    int st = 0, end = numbers.size() - 1, currentSum = 0;
    while (st < end) {
      currentSum = numbers.at(st) + numbers.at(end);
      if (currentSum == target) {
        return {(st + 1), (end + 1)};
      } else if (currentSum < target) {
        st++;
      } else {
        end--;
      }
    }
    return {};
  }
};
```

# Notes

Simple two-pointers practice question, the idea is to increase starting pointer when sum is less than target and to decrease the end pointer if sum is greater than target. This just works because the array is sorted in non - decreasing order.
