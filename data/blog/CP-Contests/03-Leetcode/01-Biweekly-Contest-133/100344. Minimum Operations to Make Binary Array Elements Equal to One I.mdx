# [100344. Minimum Operations to Make Binary Array Elements Equal to One I](https://leetcode.com/contest/biweekly-contest-133/problems/minimum-operations-to-make-binary-array-elements-equal-to-one-i/)

You are given a binary array `nums`.

You can do the following operation on the array **any** number of times (possibly zero):

- Choose **any** 3 **consecutive** elements from the array and **flip** **all** of them.

**Flipping** an element means changing its value from 0 to 1, and from 1 to 0.

Return the **minimum** number of operations required to make all elements in `nums` equal to 1. If it is impossible, return -1.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [0,1,1,1,0,0]
Output: 3
Explanation: We can do the following operations:
- Choose the elements at indices 0, 1 and 2.
  The resulting array is `nums = [1,0,0,1,0,0]`.
- Choose the elements at indices 1, 2 and 3.
  The resulting array is `nums = [1,1,1,0,0,0]`.
- Choose the elements at indices 3, 4 and 5.
  The resulting array is `nums = [1,1,1,1,1,1]`.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [0,1,1,1]
Output: -1
Explanation: It is impossible to make all elements equal to 1.
```

**Constraints:**

- `3 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 1`

# My Approach

```cpp
class Solution {
 public:
  int minOperations(vector<int>& nums) {
    int ct = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
      if (nums.at(i) == 0) {
        if (nums.size() < (i + 3)) {
          return -1;
        }
        ct++;
        nums.at(i) = !nums.at(i);
        nums.at(i + 1) = !nums.at(i + 1);
        nums.at(i + 2) = !nums.at(i + 2);
      }
    }
    return ct;
  }
};
```

# Intuition

All windows of length 3 must be satisfied by making all `0's` as `1's` starting from the left till the end of the array.
