# [485. Max Consecutive Ones](https://leetcode.com/problems/max-consecutive-ones/description/)

Given a binary array `nums`, return the maximum number of consecutive `1`'s in the array.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,1,0,1,1,1]
Output: 3
Explanation: The first two digits or the last three digits are consecutive 1s. The maximum number of consecutive 1s is 3.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [1,0,1,1,0,1]
Output: 2
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `nums[i]` is either `0` or `1`.

# My Approach

```cpp
class Solution {
 public:
  int findMaxConsecutiveOnes(vector<int>& nums) {
    int n = nums.size(), cct = 0, maxCct = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      if (nums[i]) {
        cct++;
      } else {
        maxCct = max(cct, maxCct);
        cct = 0;
      }
    }
    maxCct = max(cct, maxCct);
    return maxCct;
  }
};
```
