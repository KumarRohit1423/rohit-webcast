Given an array arr of n positive integers, your task is to find all the leaders in the array. An element of the array is considered a leader if it is greater than all the elements on its right side or if it is equal to the maximum element on its right side. The rightmost element is always a leader.

### Examples

```
Input: n = 6, arr[] = {16,17,4,3,5,2}
Output: 17 5 2
Explanation: Note that there is nothing greater on the right side of 17, 5 and, 2.
```

```
Input: n = 5, arr[] = {10,4,2,4,1}
Output: 10 4 4 1
Explanation: Note that both of the 4s are in output, as to be a leader an equal element is also allowed on the right. side
```

```
Input: n = 4, arr[] = {5, 10, 20, 40}
Output: 40
Explanation: When an array is sorted in increasing order, only the rightmost element is leader.
```

```
Input: n = 4, arr[] = {30, 10, 10, 5}
Output: 30 10 10 5
Explanation: When an array is sorted in non-increasing order, all elements are leaders.
```

**Expected Time Complexity:** O(n)  
**Expected Auxiliary Space:** O(n)

**Constraints:**  
`1 <= n <= 10^7`  
`0 <= arr[i] <= 10^7`

# My Approach

```cpp
class Solution {
  // Function to find the leaders in the array.
 public:
  vector<int> leaders(int n, int arr[]) {
    vector<int> st;
    st.emplace_back(arr[n - 1]);
    for (int i = (n - 2); i >= 0; i--) {
      if (arr[i] >= st.front()) {
        st.emplace(st.begin(), arr[i]);
      }
    }
    return st;
  }
};
```

A simple straightforward approach was to look for leaders from reverse direction while comparing with the last found leader. The only thing worth noting is that the output must be returned in original order so the output array should be reversed or elements should be added in reverse order (as I did).
