Given an array containing **N** integers and an integer **K**., Your task is to find the length of the longest Sub-Array with the sum of the elements equal to the given value **K**.

**Example 1:**

```
Input:
A[] = {10, 5, 2, 7, 1, 9}
K = 15
Output : 4
Explanation: The sub-array is {5, 2, 7, 1}.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input :
A[] = {-1, 2, 3}
K = 6
Output: 0
Explanation: There is no such sub-array with sum 6.
```

**Your Task:**  
This is a function problem. The input is already taken care of by the driver code. You only need to complete the function **lenOfLongSubarr()** that takes an array **(A)**, sizeOfArray **(n)**, sum **(K)** and **returns** the required length of the longest Sub-Array. The driver code takes care of the printing.

**Expected Time Complexity:** O(N).  
**Expected Auxiliary Space:** O(N).

**Constraints:**  
`1<=N<=10^5`  
`-10^5 <= A[i], K <= 10^5`

# My Approach

```cpp
class Solution {
 public:
  int lenOfLongSubarr(int A[], int N, int K) {
    unordered_map<int, int> mp;
    int maxLen = 0, prefSum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
      prefSum += A[i];
      if (prefSum == K) {
        maxLen = max(maxLen, (i + 1));
      }
      if (mp.find(prefSum - K) != mp.end()) {
        maxLen = max(maxLen, (i - mp[prefSum - K]));
      }
      if (mp.find(prefSum) == mp.end()) {
        mp[prefSum] = i;
      }
    }
    return maxLen;
  }
};
```

# Notes

The best thing to note about this is that the variation with only positive elements is a basic sliding window / two-pointer question which can be solved with constant extra space.

You see, the problem with negative elements is that the running sum is not guaranteed to be increasing or same. It can dip too. This small problem call for extra memory requirement to store prefix-sums.
