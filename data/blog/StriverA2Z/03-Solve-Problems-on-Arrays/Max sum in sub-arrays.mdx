summary: Given an array `Arr`, with indexes running from `0` to `N-1`, select any two indexes, `i` and `j` such that `i<=j-1`. From subarray `Arr[i...j]`, find the two smallest numbers and add them, you will get score for that subarray. Your task is to return maximum score possible in the given array Arr.

Given an array **Arr**, with indexes running from **0 to N-1**, select any two indexes, **i** and **j** such that `i <= j-1`. From subarray **Arr\[i...j\]**, find the **two smallest numbers** and add them, you will get **score** for that subarray. Your task is to return **maximum score** possible in the given array **Arr**.

**Example 1:**

```
Input : arr[] = [4, 3, 1, 5, 6]
Output : 11
Subarrays with smallest and
second smallest are,
[4, 3]
smallest = 3    second smallest = 4
[4, 3, 1]
smallest = 1    second smallest = 3
[4, 3, 1, 5]
smallest = 1    second smallest = 3
[4, 3, 1, 5, 6]
smallest = 1    second smallest = 3
[3, 1]
smallest = 1    second smallest = 3
[3, 1, 5]
smallest = 1    second smallest = 3
[3, 1, 5, 6]
smallest = 1    second smallest = 3
[1, 5]
smallest = 1    second smallest = 5
[1, 5, 6]
smallest = 1    second smallest = 5
[5, 6]
smallest = 5    second smallest = 6
Maximum sum among all
above choices is, 5 + 6 = 11
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input : arr[] = {5, 4, 3, 1, 6}
Output : 9
```

**Your Task:**
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function **pairWithMaxSum()** which takes the array **Arr\[\]** and its size **N** as inputs and returns the maximum sum of smallest and second smallest elements chosen from all possible subarrays.

**Expected Time Complexity:** O(N)  
**Expected Auxiliary Space:** O(1)

**Constraints:**  
`2 ≤ N ≤ 10^5`
`1 ≤ A[i] ≤ 10^18`

# My Approach

```cpp
class Solution {
 public:
  long long pairWithMaxSum(long long arr[], long long N) {
    long long currentSum = 0, bestSum = INT_MIN;
    for (int i = 1; i < N; i++) {
      currentSum = arr[i - 1] + arr[i];
      bestSum = max(currentSum, bestSum);
    }
    return bestSum;
  }
};
```

# Notes

A constant size 2 sliding window and checking for the maximum sum out of all windows.
