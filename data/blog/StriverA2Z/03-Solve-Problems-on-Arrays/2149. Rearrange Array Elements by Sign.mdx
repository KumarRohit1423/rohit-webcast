# [2149. Rearrange Array Elements by Sign](https://leetcode.com/problems/rearrange-array-elements-by-sign/description/)

You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums` of **even** length consisting of an **equal** number of positive and negative integers.

You should return the array of nums such that the the array follows the given conditions:

- Every **consecutive pair** of integers have **opposite signs** .
- For all integers with the same sign, the **order** in which they were present in `nums` is **preserved** .
- The rearranged array begins with a positive integer.

Return the modified array after rearranging the elements to satisfy the aforementioned conditions.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [3,1,-2,-5,2,-4]
Output: [3,-2,1,-5,2,-4]
Explanation:
The positive integers in nums are [3,1,2]. The negative integers are [-2,-5,-4].
The only possible way to rearrange them such that they satisfy all conditions is [3,-2,1,-5,2,-4].
Other ways such as [1,-2,2,-5,3,-4], [3,1,2,-2,-5,-4], [-2,3,-5,1,-4,2] are incorrect because they do not satisfy one or more conditions.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [-1,1]
Output: [1,-1]
Explanation:
1 is the only positive integer and -1 the only negative integer in nums.
So nums is rearranged to [1,-1].
```

**Constraints:**

- `2 <= nums.length <= 2 * 10^5`
- `nums.length` is **even**
- `1 <= |nums[i]| <= 10^5`
- `nums` consists of **equal** number of positive and negative integers.

It is not required to do the modifications in-place.

# My Approach

```cpp
class Solution {
 public:
  vector<int> rearrangeArray(vector<int>& nums) {
    vector<int> ans;
    int pos = 0;
    int neg = 0;
    while (pos < nums.size() && neg < nums.size()) {
      while (nums.at(neg) > 0) {
        neg++;
      }
      while (nums.at(pos) < 0) {
        pos++;
      }
      ans.emplace_back(nums.at(pos++));
      ans.emplace_back(nums.at(neg++));
    }
    return ans;
  }
};
```

# Notes

The above approach is worse than `O(n)`. This is what I naively came up with. Instead of finding required parity elements we can easily put the current element in its parity place. This method is `O(n)`.

# Better Approach

```cpp
class Solution {
 public:
  vector<int> rearrangeArray(vector<int>& nums) {
    vector<int> ans(nums.size());
    int pos = 0;
    int neg = 1;
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
      if (nums.at(i) > 0) {
        ans.at(pos) = nums.at(i);
        pos += 2;
      } else {
        ans.at(neg) = nums.at(i);
        neg += 2;
      }
    }
    return ans;
  }
};
```
