summary: Given an array Arr of size N, print the second largest distinct element from an array. If the second largest element doesn't exist then return -1.

Given an array **Arr** of size **N**, print the **second largest** distinct element from an array. **If the second largest element doesn't exist then return -1.**

**Example 1:**

```
Input:
N = 6
Arr[] = {12, 35, 1, 10, 34, 1}
Output: 34
Explanation: The largest element of the array is 35 and the second largest element is 34.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input:
N = 3
Arr[] = {10, 5, 10}
Output: 5
Explanation: The largest element of the array is 10 and the second largest element is 5.
```

**Your Task:**  
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function **print2largest()** which takes the array of integers **arr** and **n** as parameters and returns an integer denoting the answer. **If 2nd largest element doesn't exist then return -1.**

**Expected Time Complexity:** O(N)  
**Expected Auxiliary Space:** O(1)

**Constraints:**  
`2 ≤ N ≤ 10^5`  
`1 ≤ Arr[i] ≤ 10^5`

# My Approach

```cpp
class Solution {
 public:
  int print2largest(int arr[], int n) {
    int max1 = 0, max2 = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      if (arr[i] > max1) {
        max2 = max1;
        max1 = arr[i];
      } else {
        if (arr[i] > max2 && arr[i] != max1) {
          max2 = arr[i];
        }
      }
    }
    if (max1 != max2 && max2 != 0) {
      return max2;
    }
    return -1;
  }
};
```

# Notes

A tricky one for me. The check for making sure the numbers remain distinct had me in a bind for a while.
