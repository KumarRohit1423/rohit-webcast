Given an array **arr\[\]** sorted in ascending order of size **N** and an integer **K**. Check if K is present in the array or not.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: N = 5, K = 6
arr[] = {1,2,3,4,6}
Output: 1
Exlpanation: Since, 6 is present in the array at index 4 (0 based indexing), output is 1.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: N = 5, K = 2
arr[] = {1,3,4,5,6}
Output: -1
Exlpanation: Since, 2 is not present in the array, output is -1.
```

**Your Task:**  
You don't need to read input or print anything. Complete the function **searchInSorted()** which takes the sorted array arr\[\], its size N and the element K as input parameters and returns 1 if K is present in the array, else it returns -1.

**Expected Time Complexity:** O(Log N)  
**Expected Auxiliary Space:** O(1)

**Constraints:**  
`1 <= N <= 10^6`
`1 <= K <= 10^6`  
`1 <= arr[i] <= 10^6`

# My Approach

```cpp
class Solution {
 public:
  int searchInSorted(int arr[], int N, int K) {
    int lo = 0, hi = N, mid = 0;
    while (hi - lo > 1) {
      mid = (hi + lo) / 2;
      if (arr[mid] >= K) {
        hi = mid;
      } else {
        lo = mid + 1;
      }
    }
    if (arr[hi] == K || arr[lo] == K) {
      return 1;
    } else {
      return -1;
    }
  }
};
```
