# [169. Majority Element](https://leetcode.com/problems/majority-element/description/)

Given an array `nums` of size `n`, return the majority element.

The majority element is the element that appears more than `⌊n / 2⌋` times. You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [3,2,3]
Output: 3
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [2,2,1,1,1,2,2]
Output: 2
```

**Constraints:**

- `n == nums.length`
- `1 <= n <= 5 * 10^4`
- `-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`

**Follow-up:** Could you solve the problem in linear time and in `O(1)` space?

# My Approach

```cpp
class Solution {
 public:
  int majorityElement(vector<int>& nums) {
    int choice = nums.at(0), count = 1;
    for (int i = 1; i < nums.size(); i++) {
      if (count == 0) {
        choice = nums.at(i);
      }
      if (choice != nums.at(i)) {
        count--;
      } else {
        count++;
      }
    }
    return choice;
  }
};
```

# Notes

A great learning from this easy question is that we can keep a choice element in most questions which can be number or character with maximum frequency, which in turn can be switched to a better alternative mid-process. Here, once the count for the choice element drops to zero, we switch it to the next one.
