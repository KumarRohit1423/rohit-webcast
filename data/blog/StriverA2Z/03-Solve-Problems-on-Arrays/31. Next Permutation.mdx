# [31. Next Permutation](https://leetcode.com/problems/next-permutation/description/)

A **permutation** of an array of integers is an arrangement of its members into a sequence or linear order.

- For example, for `arr = [1,2,3]`, the following are all the permutations of `arr`: `[1,2,3], [1,3,2], [2, 1, 3], [2, 3, 1], [3,1,2], [3,2,1]`.

The **next permutation** of an array of integers is the next lexicographically greater permutation of its integer. More formally, if all the permutations of the array are sorted in one container according to their lexicographical order, then the **next permutation** of that array is the permutation that follows it in the sorted container. If such arrangement is not possible, the array must be rearranged as the lowest possible order (i.e., sorted in ascending order).

- For example, the next permutation of `arr = [1,2,3]` is `[1,3,2]`.
- Similarly, the next permutation of `arr = [2,3,1]` is `[3,1,2]`.
- While the next permutation of `arr = [3,2,1]` is `[1,2,3]` because `[3,2,1]` does not have a lexicographical larger rearrangement.

Given an array of integers `nums`, find the next permutation of `nums`.The replacement must be [in place](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm) and use only constant extra memory.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3]
Output: [1,3,2]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [3,2,1]
Output: [1,2,3]
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums = [1,1,5]
Output: [1,5,1]
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 100`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 100`

# My Approach

```cpp
class Solution {
 public:
  void nextPermutation(vector<int>& nums) {
    if (nums.size() < 2) {
      return;
    }
    int n = nums.size(), flag = 0;
    for (int i = n - 1; i > 0; i--) {
      if (nums.at(i) > nums.at(i - 1)) {
        int k = n;
        while (nums.at(i - 1) >= nums.at(--k))
          ;
        swap(nums.at(i - 1), nums.at(k));
        reverse(nums.begin() + i, nums.end());
        flag = 1;
        break;
      }
    }
    if (!flag) {
      reverse(nums.begin(), nums.end());
    }
    return;
  }
};
```

# Notes

I understand why this should be an inbuilt function in all programming languages. First of all I had a hard time understanding what next-permutation actually aims to achieve.

Seeing the complete array as a number made things easier. But that introduced many problems when deriving an algorithm. I'll start with two basic things -

- Notice a fully non - increasing sorted array is the last permutation for any array.
- Reverse that previous array and you get the next permutation.

Now, comes the tricky part. Once we get to the point where the right part is a non-increasing sorted array, we need to get the next bigger number than the one at current index from the right, swap both of these and then reverse the right part. This works for obvious reasons.
