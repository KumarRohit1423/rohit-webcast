Pre-final year student pusruing B.E. in Information Technology at UIETH, Panjab University. A tech enthusiast at heart, I love to explore new technologies and advances in the vast domain of Computer Sciences.

Currently I have experience in developing web applications using PERN while also having an intermediate understanding of C and C++. I am also a ardent competitive programmer and trying my level best to sharpen my DSA and problem solving skill. I am always eager to learn new things and improve my skills. Looking forward to contributing to open source projects and collaborating with other developers.
